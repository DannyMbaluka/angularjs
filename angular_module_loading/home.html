            <p>When writing configuration for a module, it’s important to note that there are only a few types
                of objects that we can inject into the .config() function: providers and constants</p>

        <div class="col-md-3">
            <h4>.run(function(){})</h4>
            <p>Unlike the configuration blocks, run blocks are executed after the injector is created and are the
                first methods that are executed in any Angular app. Typically, these run blocks are places where we’ll set up event listeners that should happen at
                the global scale of the app. For example, we’ll use the .run() block to set up listeners for routing
                events or unauthenticated requests.</p>
